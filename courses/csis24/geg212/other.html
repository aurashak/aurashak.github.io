        <h4>Student Responsibilities</h4>




        <h3>This course requires a significant amount of independent work and time management. Students have the flexibility to complete each week’s assignment at any time during the week, but it is strongly recommended that you schedule at least 8-10 hours per week on your calendar to dedicate to this course. In some weeks, the course may take more time, and in other weeks, less. You will be given the structure, resources and guidance for learning the course content. But it is ultimately your responsibility to complete assignments on time, to learn new methods when necessary, and to seek out and share information as needed to complete the course successfully. Students are expected to stay engaged and informed about the course by reading the weekly course announcements, and posting to and participating in the course Discussion Forum. Students are also expected to attend the professor’s online office hours to receive individual feedback and guidance how to succeed in the course.
Each student is responsible for the following:
<ul>
    <li>Completely reading the syllabus and understanding the course requirements;</li>
    <li>Staying informed and up-to-date on all course-related work each and every week;</li>
    <li>Reading all course announcements from the professor;</li>
    <li>Accessing the weekly content on Mondays anytime after 1:00 pm;</li>
    <li>Participating in the Discussion Forums by posting and answering questions about the respective GIS skills covered each week for the benefit of other students;</li>
    <li>Maintaining respectful and professional language and etiquette both in ONLINE and all communications to the professor and fellow students;</li>
    <li>Cooperating and completing all coursework by the assigned deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<Br><br>
Most content for this course can be accessed with any computer or laptop with Internet access. Several items can also be accessed via smartphone and tablet. Students will be required to download open source software including LibreOffice and Quantum GIS (QGIS) version 2.18 or later (instructions will be provided in the following weeks). All assignments can be completed on a Windows, Mac or Linux (x86/x64) computer.
<br><Br>
Students will need a laptop or desktop to complete all weekly assignments, midterm exam, and final project. Students will be using a software and will not be compatible with a smartphone or Google Chromebook. In other words, students CAN NOT use their smartphones or Google Chromebook to complete the course activities. If a student does not have access to a laptop or desktop, please email the course professor as soon as possible.
Students are expected to back up all their course assignments and projects to an external drive regularly.</h3>


<h4>Student Responsibilities</h4>


<h4>Grading Scale</h4>
<h3>Based on each student’s weekly and overall performance, students earn scores based on the course requirements. The grading scale for the final grade is:<Br>
100 - 93 = A<Br>
90 - 92.9 = A-<Br>
89.9 - 87 = B+<Br>
86.9 - 83 = B<Br>
82.9 - 80 = B-<Br>
79.9 - 77 = C+<Br>
76.9 - 70 = C<Br>
69.9 - 62 = D<Br>
61.9 - 0 = F<Br>
  <Br>
IMPORTANT: Final grades are final. Students have the entire semester to earn the score they prefer. For students who are having challenges in earning the score they want, students are expected to reach out to the professor for feedback and guidance during the weekly online office hours. The registrar has strict rules about retroactively changing grades. If you believe that extraordinary extenuating circumstances merit consideration for your grade, issues must be raised during the semester during online office hours in a timely fashion before final grades are submitted and not after grades have been submitted.
<Br><Br>
WHAT IS ACADEMIC HONESTY, CHEATING AND PLAGIARISM?<Br>
CUNY policy states that academic dishonesty including cheating, plagiarism, internet plagiarism and obtaining unfair advantage multiple submissions is prohibited, and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. Students must familiarize themselves with the definitions and rules about cheating and plagiarism according to CUNY academic policy:
Cheating includes copying from another student during an examination or allowing another to copy your work. Unauthorized collaboration, taking an examination for another student or asking or allowing another student to take an examination for you are all cases of cheating.
Plagiarism is the act of presenting another person’s ideas, research or writing as your own. Copying another person’s actual words without the use of quotation marks and footnotes attributing the words to their source and presenting another person’s ideas or theories in your own words without acknowledging the source are all cases of plagiarism.
All unit assignments, unit quizzes, midterm exam, discussion forum posts, final project and other course requirements must be your original work.
To protect yourself against plagiarism, students are required to use Chicago style citation for all assignments and final project. Students can learn how to use the Chicago style citation here: chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html
Any case of cheating and/or plagiarism will not be tolerated. If a student has been found to have committed cheating or plagiarism in any of the course requirements, the case must be reported to the appropriate CUNY office for investigation as per CUNY policy. This might affect the student's course grade and GPA.
