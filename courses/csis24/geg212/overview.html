        <h4>Overview</h4><br>
        
        <div class="textbox">

      
        <h3>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to fundamental principles and concepts behind the use and application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS is a special type of information technology that integrates data and information from various sources as maps. It is through this integration and mapping that the question of “where” has taken on a new meaning.
        <br><br>
        IMPORTANT: This online course format requires a significant amount of independent work and
        time management. Students must schedule at least 8-10 hours per week to dedicate to this course.</h3>

        <div class="textbox">

        <h4>Course Objectives</h4><br>
        <h3>After completing all the course requirements each week, students would have learned:<br>
            1. How to think geographically and spatially<br>
            2. How to install and use a free open source GIS software called Quantum GIS (or QGIS)<br>
            3. How to conduct research and data analysis with GIS (particularly learn about the research process, and how research questions can be formulated, refined, and answered with GIS)<br>
            4. How to create digital maps using elements of cartographic principles and design<br>
            5. How to communicate research findings through digital maps using GIS<br>
            6. How to extend or apply their knowledge of GIS across different fields of study or disciplines and professional careers</h3>

    <h4>Asynchronous Course Structure</h4> <br>
    <h3>This course is designed to be fully online and asynchronous using Blackboard. As an online and asynchronous course, students have the flexibility to complete each week’s assignment at any time during the week before the assigned deadline. All weekly course content will be uploaded and accessible on the course website on Blackboard. The online and asynchronous format allows students to learn the software with pre-recorded screencasts that students can access on-demand and watch at their own pace and repeatedly if necessary. In addition, the online
and asynchronous format accommodates students who have part-time or full-time jobs, who are taking care of family members, who may become ill, or who may be in different time zones.
<br><br>
IMPORTANT: This online course format requires a significant amount of independent work and
time management. Students must schedule at least 8-10 hours per week to dedicate to this course.</h3>

<h4>Is this course a good fit for you?</h4> <br>

<h3>If you are curious, interested or passionate about maps, how to make maps, and how to use maps to better understand what is happening in the world today, this course is a good fit for you. But as with any online course, this requires time, time management, patience, and perseverance. As your professor, I am here to support you and help you succeed in the course. This said, you need to check if this course is a good fit for you in terms of your schedule, work load, and other personal responsibilities. Students will be learning a new software and there will be a lot of trial and error. To pass the course, students are required to complete weekly readings, online discussion forum responses, online unit quizzes, midterm exam, weekly lab assignments, other exercises, and a final project with a strict deadline. It is important to ask yourself if you can dedicate at least 8-10 hours per week in this course. If yes, I encourage you to continue with the course. If no, it’s understandable, and you may consider enrolling next time when your schedule permits.
<br><br>
For students who do not have at least 8-10 hours per week to complete the course requirements (due to employment, taking care of family members, and other situation), it is highly recommended that you enroll in a different course and enroll again next time when this course is a better fit for your study/work calendar. If students are unable to dedicate the time to learn the weekly content, it is very likely students will experience being behind the requirements, frustration and, eventually, a low or failing course grade. 
<br><br>

IMPORTANT: While this course is an introductory or beginner course to GIS, students must have basic computer skills, mathematical or statistical skills, and analytical skills to succeed in the course. Students are expected to be proficient in using common applications (example: using MS Word, Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, downloading files, etc.). This course is not going to teach students how to use common computer applications or basic mathematical principles. Learning a new software is similar to learning a new language. It can be difficult and requires regular and constant practice, trial and error, patience, discipline and perseverance. If you feel not ready or too stressed at the moment to learn a new software, consider enrolling next time when you have the energy and time to do so. There will be many weeks where there can be a lot of trial and error and troubleshooting on your own, and it can be very frustrating and stressful. If you are not sure if this course is a good match for you at this time, please email the course professor as soon as possible to discuss your concerns. Do not delay. This said, students who persevere in the course find the experience very rewarding. If you feel ready, have an open mind, willing to learn a new software, be patient and diligent, and have the time to dedicate to the course, I am certain you will find the course to be very useful as you continue your studies and career. Finally, students who completed the course learned an entirely new and highly in-demand GIS skill set. Many of my students were hired for paid student internships and full-time jobs as GIS analysts. In New York City, entry-level GIS analysts earn between around $70,000 annual salary, according to ziprecruiter.com.

<h4>Weekly content</h4> <Br>

<h3>Course content will be available to students on the course webpage on Blackboard on a rolling basis. In other words, new content will be released each week every Monday after 1:00 pm EST.
    Weekly course content will include any of the following: assigned reading materials from the textbook, other materials to be provided by the professor, screencasts, geospatial data, instructions for the weekly GIS assignments, and other multimedia and online materials.
    Students are expected to access ALL required learning materials for the week anytime after Monday 1 pm and complete all weekly requirements before the weekly deadline of Sunday at 11:55 pm EST.
    <br><br>
    In other words, students have around one (1) week to access the weekly materials and complete the weekly requirements. Starting early in the week is always recommended, so make a note in your weekly calendar to visit the course website on Blackboard each week anytime after Monday 1 pm.

<h4>Requirements</h4> <br>
<h3>The course requirements are the following:<br>
A. Weekly Unit Assignments (35%)<br>
C. Weekly Discussion Forum (15%)<br>
D. Final Project (45%)<br>
<br>

A. UNIT ASSIGNMENTS (35%): Students are required to complete weekly Unit Assignments that complement the weekly course content. Students may earn a maximum of twenty (20) points in each Unit Assignment and grading rubrics will accompany each unit assignment instructions. Unit assignments are to be submitted on the Blackboard course webpage. Late submissions or Unit Assignments submitted by email are not accepted and will not be graded.
<br><br>
B. DISCUSSION FORUM (20%): Students are required to post responses on the weekly Discussion Forum on the course website on Blackboard. IMPORTANT: All weekly Unit Assignments, Discussion Forum posts, and Unit Quizzes are due before 11:55 pm EST on Sundays. Because students are given around one (1) week to complete the weekly requirements, there are NO make ups for missing the requirements.
<br><br>

C. FINAL PROJECT (45%): Students are required to create a final GIS project that is focused on an issue in the physical sciences, social sciences or human-environment interactions. You will be given the general parameters of your final project and are responsible for conducting the GIS-based research, analysis and write-up of results.
<br><br>

You will submit two formats of your Final Project: a PowerPoint format AND a GIS Poster
format. Instructions will be given on Week 11.
