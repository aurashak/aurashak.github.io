          <h4>Course Logistics and Technology</h4>
          <h3>This course will be taught in person at the Spitzer School of Architecture. Some remote lectures may be held using the Zoom platform. The Zoom application should be downloaded by all students; invitations to each scheduled Zoom meeting will be sent with a passcode. Personal Laptop and Computation Requirement:Communication will happen only via CCNY Email. Students are required to check their CCNY Email regularly and respond if needed in time. Personal laptop computers should be brought to the school for in-person classes. For any remote class meeting on Zoom, students will need a stable internet connection and a laptop computer that will allow for class participation using both video (camera) and screen sharing. Technical support is available to Spitzer School of Architecture students by contacting the CCNY IT Service Desk. <br>CCNY IT Service Desk<br><a href="mailto:servicedesk@ccny.cuny.edu">servicedesk@ccny.cuny.edu</a><br>212 650 7878 Mon-Fri 8.00am-6.00pm</h3>  
          <br>        

          <h4> Course Expectations and Grading Requirements </h4>
          <h3><u>Attendance</u><br>Note the Policy on Lateness and Absence from the City College of New York’s 2022-2023 Graduate Bulletin: <a href="https://ccny.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2022-2023/Graduate-Bulletin">https://ccny.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2022-2023/Graduate-Bulletin</a><br><br>
          “Students are expected to attend every class session of each course in which they are enrolled and to be on time. An instructor has the right to drop a student from a course for excessive
          absence. Students are advised to determine the instructor’s policy at the first class session. They should note that an instructor might treat lateness as equivalent to absence. No distinction is
          made between excused and unexcused absences. Each instructor retains the right to establish his or her own policy, but students should be guided by the following general College policy:
          In courses designated as clinical, performance, laboratory or fieldwork courses, the limit on absences is established by the individual instructor. For all other courses, the number of hours absent may not exceed twice the number of contact hours the course meets per week.”
          ollowing the Graduate Bulletin policy above, you will fail this course with a grade of WU (withdrew unofficially) if you miss more than four sessions. Missing classes for religious observance or
          jury duty are exceptions to this rule. Your instructors will record your attendance and you are responsible for notifying instructors prior to an absence whenever possible. In notifying your
          instructor about an absence or another issue, please append a copy of a doctor’s note or other written proof of the seriousness of the situation at hand.</h3>
          <br/>
                
          <h3><u>Absence &amp; Lateness: </u><br>Arriving more than ten minutes late to class will constitute an absence. Two unexcused absences will result in a whole letter grade deduction from a final grade; more than four will result in a
          failing grade. It is expected that all students will participate in all scheduled working, midterm and final reviews and contribute constructively to the discussions.</h3>
          <br/>
                  
          <h3><u>Absences due to Religious Observances:</u><br> Students who will miss any class sessions, exams, presentations, trips, or the like due to a religious observance should notify the instructor at the beginning of the semester so that appropriate adjustments for observance needs can be implemented. This could include an
          opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirement that is missed because of an absence due to a religious observance on any particular day or days.</h3>
          <br/>
                  
          <h3><u>Expectations for Coursework Outside Class Hours:</u><br> Based on this CUNY policy, “a semester credit hour is an academic unit earned for fifteen
          50-minute sessions of classroom instruction with a normal expectation of two hours of outside study for each class session.” Given this explanation, coursework outside of class hours is
          generally at least twice as many hours as the class meeting time.</h3>
          <br/>
                  
          <h4>Graduate Student Grading System</h4>
    
          <h3>Course grades should reflect professional standards of ethics, timeliness, and participation,
          while also allowing room for intellectual and material experimentation by students. The “typical” grade for a course should be a B. Exceptional work can be recognized with an A or A-, but this
          work must exceed the expectation of the course and the assignments – and not merely meet those expectations in interesting ways. Brief descriptions of the letter grades are offered below as a
          guide to interpretation.<br>
          <ul>
          <li>"A": The “A” grade should be given very rarely, and used to indication that a student has
          exceeded the expectations of the course to a very unusual degree. It should be used to indicate
          that a student has exceeded the expectations of the course in terms of comprehension, while also maintaining a high professional standard for ethical behavior, completeness and timeliness. The
          student’s demonstrated comprehension of the course material must be truly exceptional across each category of issues.</li>
        </ul> 
          <ul>

          <li>A-: The grade of “A-“ should also be given rarely. It should be used to indication that a student has exceeded the expectations of the course in terms of comprehension while also maintaining a high professional standard for ethical behavior, participation, completeness and timeliness.</h3>
          <li>B+: The grade of “B+” should be given to students who have completed their work in a
                  professional and timely manner, and have exceeded the expectations of the course in some
                  specific way that deserves special recognition – but have not exceeded expectations in all areas.</li>
                  <li>"B": The grade of “B” should be given to students who have completed their work in a professional manner, including demonstrating an ability to pursue questions and issues independently in their coursework.</li>
                  <li>B-: The grade of “B-“ should be given to students whose work or performance has been slightly less than fully professional in terms of completeness, timeliness or participation but shows promise in some other way.</li>
                  <li>C+: Students whose performances is incomplete or repeatedly late, or who are unprofessional in ethical terms, unwilling to cooperate with peers in group settings or whose work shows serious gaps in comprehension should receive grades lower than B-.</li>
                  <li>F   Students who clearly do not complete a course or whose work does not meet professional standards should receive a failing grade.</li>
                  <li>INC  Grades of “incomplete” are not given under any circumstances unless there is evidence of a medical or personal emergency. In such cases, instructor and student develop a contract to complete work by a specified date, as per CCNY policy. Classes and/or work missed due to illness must be explained with a physician’s note.</li>
          </ul>  
                <br/>
                  
                  <h3>For more information on grading guidelines and other CCNY policies and procedures, consult the current
                  <br><a href="http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/registrar/bulletins" target="_blank">CCNY academic bulletins: https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/registrar/bulletins</a></h3>
                  
        <h3>NOTE: A grade of C is the lowest passing letter grade for graduate students. Students will not
        receive credit for this course if their final grade is less than a C (2.0 quality points). In accordance with the City College of New York’s Graduate Bulletin, a graduate student with a grade point
        average below 3.0 cannot receive a Master’s Degree. For specific program information related
        to grades, academic standing, probation, and dismissal, please meet with the graduate student advisor.</h3>
        <br>
        
        <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
        <h3>Academic dishonesty is prohibited at the City University of New York and is punishable by
        penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. Plagiarism (the presentation as one’s own work of words, drawings, ideas and opinions of someone else) is a serious instance of
        academic dishonesty. The submission of any piece of work (written, drawn, built, or photocopied) is assumed by the school to guarantee that the thoughts and expressions in it are literally the
        student’s own, executed by the student. All assignments must be the student’s original work,
        produced for this class and no other. Any copying, even short excerpts, from another book, article, or Internet source, published or unpublished, without proper attribution or citation will result in
        automatic failure of the entire course.</h3>
        <br>
        
        
        <h3>You will fail this course if you: 1) submit work used for another course; 2) copy material and submit it as your own, without using quotations and citing your source, or in any other way represent the work of another person as your own; 3) submit the same work as another student. Plagiarized work will be reported to the CCNY Academic Integrity Committee, as per the CUNY Policy on Academic
        Integrity.<br>
        <a href="http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/about/integrity" class="a" target="_blank">CCNY Academic Integrity Policy: https://</a><a href="http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/about/integrity" target="_blank">www.ccny.cuny.edu/about/integrity</a></h3>
        <br>
       
       
        <h4>Classroom Expectations</h4>
        <h3>Classroom Civility<br>
        All students are expected to participate in class discussions. Meaningful and constructive
        dialogue is encouraged; however, discussions should be civilized and respectful to everyone, as well as relevant to the topic being discussed. This requires a willingness to listen, tolerance for different points of view, and mutual respect from all participants. All students will be expected to show respect for individual differences and viewpoints at all times. Guests critics invited to classes and/or review sessions will be informed of this expectation for civility.</h3>
        <br>
        
                  
        <h3>Use of Electronic Devices<br>
        All students are expected to engage in active learning during class time, including during remote Zoom instruction. The use of mobile phones, texting, chat features, and social media can be 
        very distracting for both students and the instructor. Please turn off and put handheld devices away and out of view during both in-person and Zoom classes, in order to be fully present. The 
        appropriate use of laptops will be discussed. The instructor will provide periodic breaks during in-person and Zoom classes; if needed, personal devices may be used during this time.</h3>
