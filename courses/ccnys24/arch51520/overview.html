        <h4>Overview</h4><br>
        <h3>This course presents theories and research methods for studying the recent history of global urbanization. Course material will cover the evolution of cities over time, including the reasons that cities have been established, how they have grown and maintained their populations, and why some have failed. Students will learn about the physical and social geographies of urban space, including the relationships between society and nature, various typologies of design and infrastructure, and the political spectrum of urban governance. This course will cover the process of urbanization from the street level, to the world systems of state politics, cultural ideologies, and multinational economics. This course seeks to answer the question: can cities be places of social and environmental justice, or will they continue on the path of social exclusion and environmental crisis?</h3>

        <h4>Learning Objectives</h4><br>
        <h3>During this course, students will learn about:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Major theories for why urbanization and de-urbanization have occurred in recent history</li>
            <li>The impacts that urbanization patterns are having on contemporary local and global social inequality and environmental sustainability</li>
            <li>State planning practices that intend to serve the common good</li>
            <li>Community-based visions for urbanization that counter the state</li>
            <li>Examples of compelling urban development projects, including parks, infrastructure, housing, transportation, and more</li>
            <li>Methods for crafting theories of urban planning and design, from the local to global scale</li>

        <h4>Course Structure</h4><br>
        <h3>This semester consists of four modules. Each module includes 2 readings per week and one assignment due at the end. Instructions for assignments will be posted on Blackboard.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Module I: The Physical Geography of Cities (Weeks 1-3): </u> This module explores urbanization as a global phenomenon. Students will study the range of spatial typologies that are exhibited by cities around the world. Students will learn how physical geographies, including proximity to natural resources, elevation levels, access to routes of transportation, and more, have contributed to the design of cities. This module also studies how physical geographies have shaped social practices in cities and vice versa, otherwise known as “urban political ecology”.</li>
            <li><u>Module II: Uneven Development (Weeks 4-7):</u> This module provides an overview of the power structures that have governed contemporary processes of urbanization. Like with other aspects of society, cities are outcomes of a political process. That political process is itself shaped by economics, culture, nature, and vice versa. By studying concepts of governance, political economy, and social justice, students will learn to determine the causes of inequality between large social groups in cities, a theoretical framework known as “uneven development”.</li>
            <li><u>Module III: Urbanization from below (Weeks 8-11)</u>: This module will cover the concept of urbanization from below, in which communities lead the process of research, planning, design, and management of urban space. Theories such as participatory planning, southern urbanism, municipalism, and others, will be used to explain the phenomenon in which communities protest state planning projects, while crafting their own vision for the future. Students will study these counter-planning efforts through the lens of urban social movements, such as environmentalism, the “Arab Spring”, the Paris Commune, and more.</li>
            <li><u>Module IV: Worldbuilding (Weeks 12-15):</u> Urbanization has happened so extensively that some have labeled our time the “urban age”. However, threats ranging from climate change, to political instability, to artificial intelligence, all possess the ability to increase urban social inequality, if not entirely destroy cities. This module presents futuristic visions being developed to avert or mitigate the impact of these threats. Students will review competing ideas for the future, ranging from techno-utopianism, to degrowth and preservation.</h3></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Methodologies</h4><br>
        <h3>This course is reading and design intensive. Each week will include assigned readings, along with supplemental materials in the form of podcasts, film clips, video lectures, and more. With the knowledge gained from the readings in each module, students will engage in design exercises, including cartography, graphic design, diagramming, archival documentation, and more. Some writing will be required for each assignment and for in-class exercises.</h3>

        <h4>Grading</h4><br>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Weekly reading and class discussion (25%):</u> Students are required to complete a weekly reading assignment and share reading-based discussion points in class. Readings will be posted at least one week before class. Students are expected to make notations of their reading, including questions they may have and content related to course lectures and discussion topics.</li>
            <li><u>Weekly design exercise and class participation (45%):</u> Students are required to participate in weekly mapping and design exercises, including sharing their work in class. Exercises will be done online and in class, in the form of personal and collaborative projects. Instructions for assignments will be shared in class and online at the course website. Design exercises must reflect content from the readings and class discussions.</li>
            <li><u>Final Project (30%):</u> Students will create a final design project that is the culmination of the semester. The final project can be digital and/or analog. The final project must demonstrate detailed geographic knowledge of, and cartographic depiction of, a place and set of issues that will be workshopped with fellow students and the professor throughout the semester.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Assignment instructions and due dates will be posted oon this site at: <a href="https://aurashak.github.io/courses/ccnys24/ccnys24syllabus/assignments.html">Assignments</a> section</h3>
