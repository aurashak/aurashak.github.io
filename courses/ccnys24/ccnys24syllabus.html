            <h4>COURSE OVERVIEW</h4>
            <p>This course presents theories and research methods for studying the recent history of global urbanization. Course material will cover the evolution of cities over time, including the reasons that cities have been established, how they have grown and maintained their populations, and why some have failed. Students will learn about the physical and social geographies of urban space, including the relationships between society and nature, various typologies of design and infrastructure, and the political spectrum of urban governance. This course will cover the process of urbanization from the street level, to the world systems of state politics, cultural ideologies, and multinational economics.</p>
            <p>This course seeks to answer the question: can cities be places of social and environmental justice, or will they continue on the path of social exclusion and environmental crisis?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h4>
            <p>During this course, students will learn about:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Major theories for why urbanization and de-urbanization have occurred in recent history</li>
              <li>The impacts that urbanization patterns are having on contemporary local and global social inequality and environmental sustainability</li>
              <li>State planning practices that intend to serve the common good</li>
              <li>Community-based visions for urbanization that counter the state</li>
              <li>Examples of compelling urban development projects, including parks, infrastructure, housing, transportation, and more</li>
              <li>Methods for crafting theories of urban planning and design, from the local to global scale</li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>COURSE STRUCTURE + SCHEDULE</h4>
            <p>This semester consists of four modules. Each module includes 2 readings per week and one assignment due at the end. Instructions for assignments will be posted on Blackboard.</p>
            <p>Module I: The Physical Geography of Cities (Weeks 1-3)</p>
            <p>This module explores urbanization as a global phenomenon. Students will study the range of spatial typologies that are exhibited by cities around the world. Students will learn how physical geographies, including proximity to natural resources, elevation levels, access to routes of transportation, and more, have contributed to the design of cities. This module also studies how physical geographies have shaped social practices in cities and vice versa, otherwise known as “urban political ecology”.</p>

            <p>Assignment #1: Spatial typology mapping</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Complete the typologies of urban space exercise on Blackboard. In the exercise, you will identify multiple urban typologies including their core physical geographic elements, their physical parameters, proximity to natural resources, key pieces of infrastructure, and more. This assignment utilizes digital mapping techniques.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Module II: Uneven Development (Weeks 4-7)</p>
            <p>This module provides an overview of the power structures that have governed contemporary processes of urbanization. Like with other aspects of society, cities are outcomes of a political process. That political process is itself shaped by economics, culture, nature, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>By studying concepts of governance, political economy, and social justice, students will learn to determine the causes of inequality between large social groups in cities, a theoretical framework known as “uneven development”.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Complete the political anthropology exercise on Blackboard. In this exercise, you will learn the political structure of a city and how politics are reflected in the city's physical geography. Your research will show who political constituencies are, where they are located in the city, and how theories of governance translate into the socioeconomic conditions of communities in the city. This is a research and writing assignment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Module III: Urbanization from below (Weeks 8-11)</p>
            <p>This module will cover the concept of urbanization from below, in which communities lead the process of research, planning, design, and management of urban space. Theories such as participatory planning, southern urbanism, municipalism, and others, will be used to explain the phenomenon in which communities protest state planning projects, while crafting their own vision for the future. Students will study these counter-planning efforts through the lens of urban social movements, such as environmentalism, the “Arab Spring”, the Paris Commune, and more.</p>

            <p>Module IV: Worldbuilding (Weeks 12-15)</p>
            <p>Urbanization has happened so extensively that some have labeled our time the “urban age”.</p>
            <p>However, threats ranging from climate change, to political instability, to artificial intelligence, all possess the ability to increase urban social inequality, if not entirely destroy cities. This module presents futuristic visions being developed to avert or mitigate the impact of these threats.</p>
            <p>Students will review competing ideas for the future, ranging from techno-utopianism, to degrowth and preservation.</p>

                          <p>made between excused and unexcused absences. Each instructor retains the right to establish his or her own policy, but students should be guided by the following general College policy:</p>
                          <p>In courses designated as clinical, performance, laboratory or fieldwork courses, the limit on</p>
                          <p>absences is established by the individual instructor. For all other courses, the number of hours absent may not exceed twice the number of contact hours the course meets per week.”</p>

                  <p class="s3">Absences due to Religious Observances</p>
                  <p>Students who will miss any class sessions, exams, presentations, trips, or the like due to a religious observance should notify the instructor at the beginning of the semester so that appropriate adjustments for observance needs can be implemented. This could include an</p>

                  <p class="s3">Expectations for Coursework Outside Class Hours</p>
                  <p>Based on this CUNY policy, “a semester credit hour is an academic unit earned for fifteen</p>
                  <p>50-minute sessions of classroom instruction with a normal expectation of two hours of outside study for each class session.” Given this explanation, coursework outside of class hours is</p>

                  <p>work must exceed the expectation of the course and the assignments – and not merely meet those expectations in interesting ways. Brief descriptions of the letter grades are offered below as a</p>
                  <p>guide to interpretation.</p>

                  <p>The grade of “A-“ should also be given rarely.

                  <p>professional and timely manner, and have exceeded the expectations of the course in some</p>
                  <p>specific way that deserves special recognition – but have not exceeded expectations in all areas.</p>

        <p>NOTE: A grade of C is the lowest passing letter grade for graduate students. Students will not</p>
        <p>receive credit for this course if their final grade is less than a C (2.0 quality points). In accordance with the City College of New York’s Graduate Bulletin, a graduate student with a grade point</p>
        <p>average below 3.0 cannot receive a Master’s Degree. For specific program information related</p>
        <p>to grades, academic standing, probation, and dismissal, please meet with the graduate student advisor.</p>

        <p>Academic Integrity</p>
        <p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Academic dishonesty is prohibited at the City University of New York and is punishable by</p>
        <p>penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. Plagiarism (the presentation as one’s own work of words, drawings, ideas and opinions of someone else) is a serious instance of</p>
        <p>academic dishonesty. The submission of any piece of work (written, drawn, built, or photocopied) is assumed by the school to guarantee that the thoughts and expressions in it are literally the</p>
        <p>student’s own, executed by the student. All assignments must be the student’s original work,</p>
        <p>produced for this class and no other. Any copying, even short excerpts, from another book, article, or Internet source, published or unpublished, without proper attribution or citation will result in</p>
        <p>automatic failure of the entire course.</p>
        <p><br/></p>
        <p>You will fail this course if you: 1) submit work used for another course; 2) copy material and submit it as your own, without using quotations and citing your source, or in any other way represent the work of another person as your own; 3) submit the same work as another student. Plagiarized work will be reported to the CCNY Academic Integrity Committee, as per the CUNY Policy on Academic</p>
        <p>Integrity.</p>

        <p class="s4">CLASSROOM EXPECTATIONS</p>
        <p>Classroom Civility</p>
        <p>All students are expected to participate in class discussions. Meaningful and constructive</p>
        <p>dialogue is encouraged; however, discussions should be civilized and respectful to everyone, as well as relevant to the topic being discussed. This requires a willingness to listen, tolerance for different points of view, and mutual respect from all participants. All students will be expected to show respect for individual differences and viewpoints at all times. Guests critics invited to classes and/or review sessions will be informed of this expectation for civility.</p>
        <p><br/></p>
        
                  
        <p>Use of Electronic Devices</p>
        <p>All students are expected to engage in active learning during class time, including during remote Zoom instruction. The use of mobile phones, texting, chat features, and social media can be</p>
        <p>very distracting for both students and the instructor. Please turn off and put handheld devices away and out of view during both in-person and Zoom classes, in order to be fully present. The</p>
        <p>appropriate use of laptops will be discussed. The instructor will provide periodic breaks during in-person and Zoom classes; if needed, personal devices may be used during this time.</p>
