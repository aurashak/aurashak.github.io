            <h1>Northern Manhattan Climate Action Plan Documentation</h1>
    
            <h3><b>1. Starting the planning process</b></h3>
            <h3>The NMCA was a result of planning efforts made in the wake of hurricane Sandy (2012). After Sandy, public institutions and philanthropic organizations provided grants for NGOs around New York City to engage in planning efforts. This effort received a grant of several hundred thousand dollars to do planning for several years, resulting in a resilience plan for Northern Manhattan.<br> <br></h3>
    
            <h3><b>2. Leadership organization</b></h3>
            <h3>The NGO that led this planning project is <a href="https://weact.org">WE ACT for Environmental Justice</a>. WE ACT has been operating in Upper Manhattan since the 1980s, when they began advocating for policy changes that would reduce pollution in the community.
                <br><br>Using their social network in the community, including their organizational membership base, and their professional staff capacity, WE ACT was able to establish a process of public engagement for planning. 
                <br><br>


                <h3><b>3. Public engagement process</b></h3>
                <h3>For the first year of the planning initiative, WE ACT staff and their membership base, conducted wide spread surveying and discourse with the public on the issue of climate change and environmental justice. Those engagements were geared towards encouraging participation in the full planning process.
                    <br><br>The planning process itself was an extensive series of meetings, including weekly membership meetings, day-long planning and design workshops, lectures, and more, where participants learned about climate change issues, as well as provided feedback on their vision for the community. For this process, Northern Manhattan was divided into four quadrants, allowing for deeper tracking of engagement for the process.<br>

                    <br><br>

                    <h3><b>4. Creating and distributing the plan</b></h3>
                    <h3>Out of the public engagement process, several working groups were established.  These topical working groups, which consisted of community members and other stakeholders, such as public officials, would meet regularly to analyze the information provided by the public and create a draft plan. This process was iterative in that interpretations of community input were first discussed with the larger community before being entered in the plan, this to ensure accuracy and accountability.
                        <br><br>My role was to manage the entire process, including the structure of the public engagement, and to facilitate creation of the plan via the working groups. The plan that was created by myself and Mateo Fernandez-Muro was in the form of technical maps and graphic illustrations. The creative design of the plan, including its pamphlet format, were designed to encourage interest in local planning and to provide easy distribution of the message. The artistic format also lent itself to presentation of multi-dimensional concepts, such as various urban scales, architectural typologies, economic frameworks, social networks, and more.

                        <h3><b>5. Implementing the plan</b></h3>
                        <h3>The NMCA includes changes in policy and the built environment that range from minute to large scale. WE ACT has maintained working groups that are tasked with implementing these initiatives, including taking action themselves, and workring within large collaobrative frameworks.</h3>
