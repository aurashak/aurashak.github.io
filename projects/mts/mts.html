The 135th Street Marine Waste Transfer Station operated for five decades as the main waste transfer station for Manhattan. The facility operated for 24 hours a day, where dump trucks from all over the borough woulud descend on West Harlem to transfer waste to barges, which were then send to Fresh Kills landfill and other final destinations. This map is part of Aurash Khawarzad's PhD research, in which he investigates the cumulative social and environmental impacts of the 135th St MTS, as well as envisioning its possible redevelopment.
