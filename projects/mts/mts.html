    <b>Overview:</b> On the west side of Harlem, New York City, between 125th and 145th streets, there is a significant amount of critical infrastructure for the island of Manhattan. Among them are the North River Wastewater Treatment Facility, the New York City Transit Manhattanville bus depot, the Williams Transco natural gas pipeline (the largest of its type in the country), railroads and high volume motorways – and the subject of this research proposal – the 135th Street Marine Waste Transfer Station (MTS). It is not coincidence that this plethora of toxic facilities are located north of 125th Street, where the majority Black population of Harlem begins, rather than south of 125th, in Morningside Heights, where it is/was mostly white. In place of toxic infrastructure, the neighborhoods south of 125th street were given the spectacularly designed Riverside Park. The result has been a dramatic level of social and environmental justice between the two coastal zones. In Harlem, the utilitarian architecture of industrial buildings not only polluted the environment, but created hostility to social activity. The West Harlem waterfront became a sacrifice zone for the larger City. In contrast, the Fredrick Law Olmstead design of Riverside Park provided residents of Morningside Heights and the Upper West Side with open green space and vibrant biodiversity, which improved environmental quality and community well-being. 
    In 2000, after forty five years of operation, the 135th Street Marine Waste Transfer Station was shuttered. The challenge now is to reverse decades of pollution and improve the waterfront based on community needs. My research will focus on the MTS, where I will ask: 1- What have been the cumulative environmental impacts of pollution emanating from the MTS during its time of operation?  2- What were the social impacts of that environmental pollution, including on the economic status and health of community members?  3- How can communities contribute to the redevelopment of the MTS into a healthy natural ecosystem and community-serving design? <br><br>
    To answer my research questions, I will 1- investigate governmental archives of the MTS to understand the history of its development and its methods of operation; 2- complete interviews with community members adjacent to the MTS in order to understand its social impact; and 3- construct a digital 3d model of my study area for the dual purpose of environmental analysis and public participation in data collection.

    <b>Background:</b> From 1955 until 2000, the 135th Street MTS operated as the only waste transfer station in Manhattan. The vast majority of curbside waste being generated on the Island was deposited at this facility. For 24-hours per day (the only 24-hour MTS in the entire City), dump trucks would unload waste onto floating barges, where it would be relocated to Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, approximately 25 miles away. The odor emanating from the facility in Harlem became a health concern for local residents, and a symbol for the community was being treated unfairly by the government. Beginning in the 1980s, community advocates formed an organization called WE ACT for Environmental Justice (WE ACT is short for West Harlem Action), which began organizing for the closure of the facility. WE ACT documented the impacts on public health, lobbied public officials, and raised awareness about the disproportionate impacts of public policy on Harlemites. After a decade of campaigning, the facility was ordered closed by the Giuliani mayoral administration, a decision later implemented by the Bloomberg administration. 
Immediately upon its closure in 2000, WE ACT transitioned to a new phase of planning the redevelopment of the MTS into a community-serving facility, including space for urban agriculture, renewable energy production, classrooms, art studios, and more. However, despite intensive efforts by the organization, the MTS has been deserted since its closure, slowly being stripped for parts. Between 2012 and 2016, I worked as a staff member at WE ACT, where I was charged with implementing the organization's urban planning projects. My role included collaborating with community members on creating a vision for the MTS, meeting with public officials to facilitate policy change and lobby for funding, and working with engineers and designers on the decommissioning and reconstruction process. WE ACT continues to advocate for redevelopment of the MTS, but change is not imminent. While the MTS, which sits 100 meters off the shoreline in the Hudson River, has remained empty, the Harlem waterfront has seen a surge in gentrification. A major expansion of the Columbia University campus, new housing construction, and other investments, means the network of stakeholders and the power dynamics of the waterfront is rapidly changing. This gentrification is a harbinger of increasing capital being allocated for waterfront redevelopment, including for the MTS, but in the image of the real estate industry, rather than the local community.
